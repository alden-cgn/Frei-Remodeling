This is Frei Remodeling's Media library. This is being used to offload the wordpress server of having to host image files and instead are serving images via JSDeliver CDN.

Here is the url format for using the images:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alden-cgn/Frei-Remodeling@main/project-images/project/image-title-here.webp

Specifically:

https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/alden-cgn/Frei-Remodeling@main/project-images/pansing/frei-remodeling-pansing-whole-home-project-01.webp


Clone this repo in VSCODE and from the terminal navigate to /project-images (this is where generate-readmes.js is located). Run "node generate-readmes.js" and this will create visual readme files for all the image portfolios so you can see them visually in github!
